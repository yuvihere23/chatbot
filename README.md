### 🧪 Azure GPT Cloud Bot – Mini PoC Summary

**Goal:**
Build a Proof-of-Concept chatbot that can understand natural language queries and fetch data from **Azure cloud infrastructure**, focusing on **VMs, metrics, and underutilization for cost optimization**.

---

### 🔧 What It Does

* Takes user prompt (e.g., *“List VMs with CPU usage < 20%”*)
* Uses **Gemini API** to extract intent & parameters
* Calls appropriate **Azure SDK** functions (e.g., list VMs, get metrics)
* Returns structured JSON response

---

### 🧠 Tech Stack

* **FastAPI** – Backend framework
* **Azure SDK** – Resource & metrics access
* **Gemini API** – LLM to extract intent
* **Python** – Core language
* **.env** – For securely managing keys

### 📥 Example Input

```json
POST /api/ask
{
  "prompt": "List running VMs with CPU usage under 20%"
}
```

### ✅ Output (Sample)

```json
[
  {
    "name": "vm-prod-east",
    "id": "vm123",
    "cpu_utilization": "15%",
    "status": "Running"
  }
]
```

### ➕ Future Scope

* Add support for:

  * Disks
  * Load Balancers
  * SQL Databases
  * Cost Reports
* Gemini handles more nuanced multi-part queries
* Integration with Azure Cost Management API

### 🧠 Azure GPT Cloud Bot – PoC Summary

This Proof-of-Concept chatbot uses Google Gemini to understand natural language queries about Azure infrastructure (e.g., “List VMs with CPU usage under 20%”) and maps them to relevant Azure SDK calls. It returns structured, actionable data such as VM details, metrics, and underutilized resources to help with visibility and cost optimization.

Built using FastAPI, it follows a modular architecture: Gemini handles intent extraction, Azure SDK performs data fetching, and FastAPI serves responses via a `/api/ask` endpoint. The system is designed for minimal permissions (read-only) and can be extended to support other Azure resources like disks, databases, and load balancers.

This PoC demonstrates the viability of LLM-driven cloud infrastructure assistants and sets the foundation for broader enterprise use in infrastructure monitoring and optimization.
