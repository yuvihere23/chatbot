📝 2-PAGE AIOps DOCUMENT (CI/CD Optimizer AI Agent)


---

🚨 Problem Statement

Modern CI/CD pipelines in corporate environments face challenges like:

Frequent build or deployment failures

Hardcoded secrets accidentally pushed into pipelines

Lack of early prediction before CI/CD runs

Delayed alerting and remediation


These issues lead to broken deployments, wasted compute resources, and security vulnerabilities.


---

🎯 Objective

To build an AI-powered agent that:

1. Predicts CI/CD pipeline failure likelihood before execution


2. Detects hardcoded secrets in the workflow/codebase


3. Helps DevOps teams act early, reducing failure rates and improving security




---

💡 Proposed Solution

Build an AI agent that:

Trains on historical GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline run data (status, duration, secret presence)

Learns patterns that lead to pipeline success or failure

Predicts future failures using a simple ML model before the pipeline even runs

Includes a frontend UI (Streamlit) for demo



---

🧠 Features Used for Prediction

Feature	Description

duration_sec	Time taken by the pipeline
contains_secret	Boolean flag for hardcoded secrets
is_anomaly	Runtime anomaly flag (statistical)



---

📊 Dataset Generation

Step	Description

1. ✅ Simulate 100 commits using Python script	
2. ✅ Inject ~20% failure and secret scenarios	
3. ✅ Trigger GitHub Actions on each push	
4. ✅ Use GitHub API to collect run data (status, duration, etc.)	
5. ✅ Detect secrets & anomalies programmatically	
6. ✅ Store all in pipeline_runs_dataset.csv for model training	



---

🧱 Model & Tools

Tool/Model	Purpose

RandomForestClassifier	Predict pipeline failure
joblib	Save/load trained model
requests	Fetch GitHub run data
re / regex	Detect secrets in YAML/app code
Streamlit	UI to test prediction interactively

📅 MVP Timeline (10–15 days)

Day	Task

1-3	Setup repo, build working CI/CD pipeline
4-5	Write data simulation + commit script
6-7	Collect 100+ run samples via GitHub API
8-9	Train + evaluate prediction model
10	Build prediction + UI (Streamlit)
11–14	Fine-tune features & document results
15	Prepare demo and presentation



---

🎓 Outcome

By the end of this project:

You will have a working AIOps pipeline optimizer MVP

It will predict pipeline failures before they happen

It will detect hardcoded secrets and suggest fixes

You will have built everything end-to-end: data, model, frontend, and demo

Would you like a downloadable PDF version, a PowerPoint slide, or a Notion/Markdown file for submission or presenting?

And should I generate a DAG image too for you?
